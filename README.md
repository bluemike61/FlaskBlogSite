# Team 3 FlaskBlogSite
The goal of this project was to implement a working test.py file and allow for image creation using the dockerfile to run the app in a container.
The actual app it's self is a blogging website that allows for registration, logging in, profile editing, and blog creation. For this project
we presented it as a template that can be easily changed with 6 testing jobs implemented.
